# Problem 1

This problem uses the Instacart data. DO NOT include this dataset in
your local data directory; instead, load the data from the
`p8105.datasets` using:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

### Describing the Instacart dataset

This dataset contains a total of 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each
row representing a single product from an instacart order.

Key variables include identifiers for each user, order, and product; the
order in which each product was added to the cart. There are several
order-level variables, describing the day and time of the order, as well
as number of days since prior order. There are also several
item-specific variables, describing the product name (e.g. Yogurt,
Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs, produce), and aisle
(e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether or not the item has been
ordered by the specific user in the past.

In total, there are 39123 products found in 131209 orders from 131209
distinct users.

-   How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

*There are 134 aisles in total, with most items ordered from the fresh
vegetables aisle followed closely by the fresh fruits aisle.*

-   This plot shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limited
    to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Aisles are arranged in
    ascending order of the number of items ordered in that aisle:

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_sjz2120_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="90%" />

-   This table shows the three most popular items in each of the aisles
    “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
    fruits”. The number of times each item is ordered is also included
    in this table, and the rows are ordered by descending number of
    times each item is ordered.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

-   This final table shows the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week,
    formatted as a 2x7 table.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

# Problem 2

Accelerometers have become an appealing alternative to self-report
techniques for studying physical activity in observational studies and
clinical trials, largely because of their relative objectivity. During
observation periods, the devices measure “activity counts” in a short
period; one-minute intervals are common. Because accelerometers can be
worn comfortably and unobtrusively, they produce around-the-clock
observations.

This problem uses five weeks of accelerometer data collected on a 63
year-old male with BMI 25, who was admitted to the Advanced Cardiac Care
Center of Columbia University Medical Center and diagnosed with
congestive heart failure (CHF). *In this spreadsheet, variables
activity.* are the activity counts for each minute of a 24-hour day
starting at midnight.

### Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should include all originally observed variables and values; have useful variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset (e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).

``` r
accel_data =
  read_csv(file = "./data/accel_data.csv") %>% #Read in csv file
  janitor::clean_names() %>% #Basic clean of dataset
  rename_with(.cols = starts_with("activity_"),
              .fn = ~ str_replace(string = .x, "activity_", "minute_")) %>% #Renamed all activity_* variables to minute_*
  mutate(type_of_day = recode(day, "Monday" = "Weekday", "Tuesday" = "Weekday", "Wednesday" = "Weekday", "Thursday" = "Weekday", "Friday" = "Weekday", "Saturday" = "Weekend", "Sunday" = "Weekend" )) %>% #Create new variable indicating weekday vs weekend
  select(week, day_id, day, type_of_day, everything()) #Reorganize columns so minute_* are at the end
```

    ## Rows: 35 Columns: 1443
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr    (1): day
    ## dbl (1442): week, day_id, activity.1, activity.2, activity.3, activity.4, ac...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

The cleaned and tidied dataset accel_data contains a total of 35 rows
and 1444 columns, with each row representing a single day of
accelerometer data (for each minute) for the subject. There are a total
of 5 weeks of data, with 7 days of data per week for a total of 35 total
days (observations) with accelerometer data for each minute of the day.

Key variables include `week` (the week during which the row data was
collected), `day_id` (an identifier for each of the 35 days that data
was collected for), and `day` (a label name for the day of the week); as
well as a newly created variable `type_of_day` (which indicates whether
the observation happened on a weekday vs weekend).

Other key variables include `minute_*` (renamed from `activity_*`) and
ranging from `minute_1` to `minute_1440`. The variables `minute_*` are
the activity counts for each minute of a 24-hour day starting at
midnight, hence why there are a total of 1440 `minute_*` variables
(because there are 1440 minutes in a day).

All of these variables are doubles, with the exception of the `day` and
`type_of_day` variables which are character variable types.

### Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

``` r
accel_data %>%
  mutate(daily_activity = rowSums(accel_data[ , c(5:1444)], na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  select(week, day_id, day, type_of_day, daily_activity) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

-   Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of
    the day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity
    time courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week.
    Describe in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on
    this graph.

# Problem 3

This problem uses the NY NOAA data. DO NOT include this dataset in your
local data directory; instead, load the data from the `p8105.datasets`
package using:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")

noaa = 
  ny_noaa %>% 
  as_tibble(ny_noaa)
```

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and indicating the extent to which
missing data is an issue. Then, do or answer the following (commenting
on the results of each):

-   Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month,
    and day. Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and
    snowfall are given in reasonable units. For snowfall, what are the
    most commonly observed values? Why?
-   Make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January
    and in July in each station across years. Is there any observable /
    interpretable structure? Any outliers?
-   Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset
    (note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) make
    a plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0
    and less than 100 separately by year.
